C code for shared library hijacking and function hooking

## Usage:
Replace the SHELLCODE_HERE variable with shellcode that has been modified by crypt.c (or manually XOR each byte by 0x39). The 'hijack' folder contains necessary files to perform library hijacking against libgpg-error.so.0, and the 'hook' folder contains files to perform function hooking against the geteuid function. This code is meant for x64 Linux systems.

Instructions for compiling code in the folders can be found in the C files' code comments. The run.sh scripts will automate the setup of either method by adding lines to .bashrc and/or .zshrc to set environment variables that will load the compiled code.
